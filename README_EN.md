VerbaAurea is an intelligent document preprocessing tool dedicated to transforming raw documents into "golden" knowledge, providing high-quality text data for knowledge base construction. It focuses on intelligent document segmentation, ensuring semantic integrity, and delivers premium material for knowledge base retrieval and large language model fine-tuning.

## Project Features

- **Intelligent Document Segmentation** - Precise segmentation based on sentence boundaries and semantic integrity, currently supporting only docx and doc format documents
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring System** - Considers titles, sentence integrity, paragraph length, and other factors to determine optimal split points
- **Semantic Integrity Protection** - Prioritizes the completeness of sentences and semantic units, avoiding breaks in the middle of sentences
- **Configurable Design** - Flexibly adjust segmentation strategies through configuration files without modifying code
- **Multi-language Support** - Employs different sentence segmentation strategies for Chinese and English texts
- **Format Preservation** - Maintains the original document's formatting information, including styles, fonts, and tables

## Application Scenarios

- **Knowledge Base Construction** - Provides text units of appropriate granularity for retrieval-based question answering systems

- **Corpus Preparation** - Prepares high-quality training data for large language model fine-tuning

- **Document Indexing** - Optimizes index units for document retrieval systems

- **Content Management** - Improves document organization in content management systems

## Core Functions

- **Sentence Boundary Detection** - Precisely identifies sentence boundaries by combining rules and NLP techniques
- **Split Point Scoring System** - Multi-dimensional scoring to select optimal split points
- **Semantic Block Analysis** - Analyzes document structure, preserving semantic connections between paragraphs
- **Adaptive Length Control** - Automatically adjusts text fragment length based on configuration
- **Format Preservation Processing** - Maintains the original document format while splitting

## Installation Guide

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux systems



### Installation Steps

1. Clone the project locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VerbaAurea.git
cd VerbaAurea
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## User Guide

### Basic Usage

1. Place Word documents that need processing in the script directory or subdirectories
2. Run the main script

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Select operations according to the menu:
   - Select `1` to start processing documents
   - Select `2` to view current configuration
   - Select `3` to edit configuration
   - Select `4` to exit the program

4. Processed documents will be saved in the `文件输出` (default) or custom output folder

### Configuration Instructions

You can customize segmentation parameters by editing through the menu or directly modifying the `config.json` file:

#### Document Settings

- `max_length`: Maximum paragraph length. Controls the maximum character count of each segmented text block. Too large may reduce retrieval efficiency, too small may disrupt semantic integrity.
- `min_length`: Minimum paragraph length. Prevents the generation of fragments that are too short. Text blocks that are too short may lack sufficient context, affecting knowledge base quality.
- `sentence_integrity_weight`: Sentence integrity weight. Higher values make the system more inclined to keep sentences complete, reducing the possibility of splitting in the middle of sentences.

#### Processing Options

- `debug_mode`: Debug mode. When enabled, outputs detailed processing information, including split point scoring and calculation processes. (This setting is currently mainly used for algorithm optimization research).
- `output_folder`: Output folder name. Processed documents will be saved in this folder, maintaining the original directory structure.
- `skip_existing`: Whether to skip existing files

#### Advanced Settings

- `min_split_score`: Minimum split score. Only positions with scores higher than this value will be selected as split points. Increasing this value can reduce the number of split points.
- `heading_score_bonus`: Title bonus value. Splitting before and after titles is usually more reasonable; this parameter controls the priority of title positions.
- `sentence_end_score_bonus`: Sentence ending bonus value. Increasing this value prioritizes splitting at sentence boundaries, improving document semantic integrity.
- `length_score_factor`: Length scoring factor. Controls the impact of paragraph length on scoring; larger values produce more uniform splits.
- `search_window`: Search window size. When adjusting split points to sentence boundaries, the system searches for the nearest sentence boundary within this window range.

#### Performance Settings

- `num_workers`: Number of worker processes. Setting to 0 will automatically use (CPU cores - 1) processes. Can be adjusted according to system resources.
- `cache_size`: Cache size. Used to store text analysis results to avoid repetitive calculations and improve processing speed. Unit is number of entries.
- `batch_size`: Batch size. The number of files processed by each worker process at once; larger values can reduce process switching overhead.

### Best Practices

- **Set reasonable length ranges** - Set appropriate maximum and minimum paragraph lengths based on knowledge base, fine-tuning, or application requirements
- **Adjust sentence integrity weight** - If sentences are being split, increase this weight

## How It Works

1. **Document Parsing** - Parse documents, extract text, style, and structural information
2. **Paragraph Analysis** - Analyze characteristics of each paragraph, such as length, whether it's a heading, whether it ends with a period, etc.
3. **Score Calculation** - Calculate comprehensive scores for each potential split point
4. **Split Point Selection** - Select optimal split points based on scores and configuration
5. **Sentence Boundary Correction** - Adjust split point positions to occur at sentence boundaries
6. **Split Marker Insertion** - Insert `<!--split-->` markers at selected positions
7. **Format Preservation** - Preserve the original document's formatting and save as a new document

## Development Plan

- Add support for more document formats
- Implement a graphical user interface
- Enhance semantic analysis capabilities using more advanced NLP models

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why are some paragraphs too short or too long after splitting?**

A: Try adjusting the `max_length` and `min_length` parameters in the configuration file to balance segmentation granularity.

**Q: How to avoid sentences being split in the middle?**

A: Increase the `sentence_integrity_weight` parameter value; the default value is 8.0, you can try setting it to 10.0 or higher.

**Q: How to handle documents with special formatting?**

A: For special formats, you can adapt to different document structures by adjusting the scoring parameters in the advanced settings.
